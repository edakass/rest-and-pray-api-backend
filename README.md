# Rest and Pray API - Backend

A personal side project I am currently working on.

The goal of Rest and Pray API is to provide a backend service where users can register, log in, and interact with location-based features such as searching by current location.

Location search (based on user input or current location)

## Tech Stack

Deploy a demo version for testing
